    <h1> Queen-Killer queen</h1>
    <audio src="musicas/Queen - Killer queen.mp3" controls></audio><br>
    <strong>Letra:</strong><br>
    She keeps her Moet et Chandon<br>
    In her pretty cabinet<br>
    "Let them eat cake", she says<br>
    Just like Marie Antoinette<br>
    A built-in remedy<br>
    For Khrushchev and Kennedy<br>
    At anytime an invitation<br>
    You can't decline<br>
    Caviar and cigarettes<br>
    Well versed in etiquette<br>
    Extraordinarily nice<br>
    She's a Killer Queen<br>
    Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
    Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
    Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
    Anytime<br>
    Recommended at the price<br>
    Insatiable an appetite<br>
    Wanna try?<br>
    To avoid complications<br>
    She never kept the same address<br>
    In conversation<br>
    She spoke just like a baroness<br>
    Met a man from China<br>
    Went down to Geisha Minor<br>
    Then again incidentally<br>
    If you're that way inclined<br>
    Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)<br>
    For cars she couldn't care less<br>
    Fastidious and precise<br>
    She's a Killer Queen<br>
    Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
    Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
    Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
    Anytime<br>
    Drop of a hat she's as willing as<br>
    Playful as a pussy cat<br>
    Then momentarily out of action<br>
    Temporarily out of gas<br>
    To absolutely drive you wild, wild<br>
    She's all out to get you<br>
    She's a Killer Queen<br>
    Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
    Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
    Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
    Anytime<br>
    Recommended at the price<br>
    Insatiable an appetite<br>
    Wanna try?<br>
    You wanna try<br>

    <strong>Letra:</strong><br>
    You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now<br>
    You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out<br>
    But we're so lucky<br>
    Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down<br>
    Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)<br>
    A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud<br>
    A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown<br>
    But back away from the water, babe, you might drown<br>
    The party isn't over tonight (party in your night gown)<br>
    Hey<br>
    Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?<br>
    Hey<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway (hey)<br>
    I love her anyway (hey)<br>
    I love her anyway (hey)<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty, are you nasty?<br>
    I love her anyway<br>
    Oh,<br>
    Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?<br>
    Oh<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway<br>
    Way down 'til the fire finally dies out<br>
    You've got 'em wrapped around your finger watch 'em fall down<br>
    There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out<br>
    Let me say it one more time (Tragic in the fall out)<br>
    Hey<br>
    Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?<br>
    Hey<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway (Hey, hey , hey)<br>
    I love her anyway (Hey)<br>
    I love her anyway (Hey)<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty, are you nasty?<br>
    I love her anyway<br>
    Oh<br>
    Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?<br>
    Oh<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway<br>
    I love her anyway<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty?<br>
    Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson<br>
    Are you nasty, are you nasty?<br>
    I love her anyway<br>
    Oh<br>
    When will you be waking up tomorrow morning?<br>
    Oh<br>
    Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway<br>

    <strong>Letra:</strong><br>
    Once upon a time not so long ago<br>
    Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike<br>
    He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough<br>
    Gina works the diner all day working for her man<br>
    She brings home her pay, for love, for love<br>
    She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
    It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
    We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
    We'll give it a shot<br>
    Woah, we're half way there<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Tommy's got his six-string in hock<br>
    Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk<br>
    So tough, it's tough<br>
    Gina dreams of running away<br>
    When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers<br>
    Baby, it's okay, someday<br>
    We've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
    It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
    We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
    We'll give it a shot<br>
    Woah, we're half way there<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Livin' on a prayer<br>
    Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
    You live for the fight when it's all that you've got<br>
    Woah, we're half way there<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Woah, we're half way there<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Woah, we're half way there<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
    Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
